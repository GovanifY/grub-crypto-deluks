[![DeLUKS: Deniable Linux Unified Key Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kriswebdev/grub-crypto-deluks/gh-pages/assets/deluks_logo.png)](https://github.com/kriswebdev/grub-crypto-deluks)

This development branch is a work in progress to specify and implement a Deniable LUKS header recognized by GRUB.

DeLUKS will provide most benefits of LUKS and of plausibly [deniable encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption).

Expected Features
===
- **QUICK BOOT!** At GRUB menu, press `c` to get into GRUB shell, then `cryptomount -x` and your password. That's all!
- **DENIABLE!**
  - DeLUKS header and encrypted payload are **indistinguishable from random data**. *"Why is there random data on your unallocated disk space? - I wiped my disk"*
  - Bootloader is nothing more than **GRUB**. If the code is integrated upstream, the setup will even be indistinguishable from mainstream GRUB *"Why do you have a bootloader with deniable decryption feature? - Do I? It's the default GRUB."*
  - **No bootloader password menu**. Base of deny, YOU command the bootloader to ask you for a password, not the other way round. *"Look, I just installed this O.S. on my wiped drive, it's GRUB's only menu choice. Where would I hide something?"*
  - DeLUKS finds encrypted disks by **scanning** & trying to mount all unallocated disk space > 2MiB.
  - **No poorly secured USB key** needed! But use one if you really want to. *"We didn't find any (1) remote header (2) unencrypted keyfile (3) loosely brute-forcable plain dm-crypt keyfile (choose one) on your USB key."*
- LUKS **multiple keyslots**: You can decrypt a disk with any one of 8 passwords. You can change and revok the passwords.
- LUKS protection **against rainbow table** attacks: Master key is encrypted with a salt.
- LUKS **slow brute-forcing**: User password is encrypted with several hash iterations and a salt.
- LUKS **anti-forensic** information splitter: Low risk that the master key could be decrypted with a revoked password (protection against damaged disk blocks storing the revoked keyslot).
- **Pure dm-crypt**, no TrueCrypt.
- **No need for Truecrypt-style "hidden partition"**. Instead, you can create a true partition with a fake O.S. GRUB will by default boot on this fake O.S.

Theoretical limitations and workarounds
===
It is difficult to write the header encryption parameters on disk without compromising deniability character or security.
Therefore the Master key / keyslots encryption parameters should use DeLUKS default presets of the installed GRUB version (or be provided through command-line arguments at each boot as an annoying last resort).

However, default presets hard-coded in GRUB-cryptomount shall regularly evolve to follow security best practices.
Hence, once GRUB is updated with newer DeLUKS default presets, it shall behave according to this procedure:
- GRUB-cryptomount will try to decrypt the disks using the latests presets.
- If GRUB-cryptomount fails to decrypt any disk, it will try with older presets.
- If GRUB-cryptomount succeds to decrypt any disk with older presets, it shall warn the user to re-create the DeLUKS header with newer presets using cryptsetup. And continue booting.

The disk payload encryption settings can be changed as these options are encrypted.
If GRUB-cryptomount detects the disk payload encryption settings to be obsolete, it shall warn the user to re-create the DeLUKS header and to re-encrypt the drive with newer presets using cryptsetup. And continue booting.
